        <h1 id="contributing-to-meson">Contributing to Meson</h1>
<p>A large fraction of Meson is contributed by people outside the core
team. This documentation explains some of the design rationales of Meson as
well as how to create and submit your patches for inclusion to Meson.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in participating to the development.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-patches">Submitting patches</h2>
<p>All changes must be submitted as <a href="https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pulls">pull requests to
Github</a>. This causes them to be
run through the CI system. All submissions must pass a full CI test run
before they are even considered for submission.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-pull-requests-up-to-date">Keeping pull requests up to date</h2>
<p>It is possible that while your pull request is being reviewed, other changes
are committed to master that cause merge conflicts that must be
resolved. The basic rule for this is very simple: keep your pull request up
to date using rebase <em>only</em>.</p>
<p>Do not merge head back to your branch. Any merge commits in your pull
request make it not acceptable for merging into master and you must remove
them.</p>
<h2 id="special-procedure-for-new-features">Special procedure for new features</h2>
<p>Every new feature requires some extra steps, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must include a project test under <code>test cases/</code>, or if that's not
possible or if the test requires a special environment, it must go into
<code>run_unittests.py</code>.</li>
<li>Must be registered with the <a href="Release-notes-for-0-47-0.html#Feature_detection_based_on_meson_version_in_project">FeatureChecks
framework</a>
that will warn the user if they try to use a new feature while targetting
an older meson version.</li>
<li>Needs a release note snippet inside <code>docs/markdown/snippets/</code> with a
heading and a brief paragraph explaining what the feature does with an
example.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="acceptance-and-merging">Acceptance and merging</h2>
<p>The kind of review and acceptance any merge proposal gets depends on the
changes it contains. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by
someone with commit rights who is not the original submitter. Merge requests
can be roughly split into three different categories.</p>
<p>The first one consists of MRs that only change the markdown documentation
under <code>docs/markdown</code>. Anyone with access rights can push changes to these
directly to master. For major changes it is still recommended to create a MR
so other people can comment on it.</p>
<p>The second group consists of merges that don't change any functionality,
fixes to the CI system and bug fixes that have added regression tests (see
below) and don't change existing functionality. Once successfully reviewed
anyone with merge rights can merge these to master.</p>
<p>The final kind of merges are those that add new functionality or change
existing functionality in a backwards incompatible way. These require the
approval of the project lead.</p>
<p>In a simplified list form the split would look like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>members with commit access can do:
<ul>
<li>documentation changes (directly to master if warranted)</li>
<li>bug fixes that don't change functionality</li>
<li>refactorings</li>
<li>new dependency types</li>
<li>new tool support (e.g. a new Doxygen-kind of tool)</li>
<li>support for new compilers to existing languages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>project leader decision is needed for:
<ul>
<li>new modules</li>
<li>new functions in the Meson language</li>
<li>syntax changes for Meson files</li>
<li>changes breaking backwards compatibility</li>
<li>support for new languages</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strategy-for-merging-pull-requests-to-trunk">Strategy for merging pull requests to trunk</h2>
<p>Meson's merge strategy should fullfill the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>preserve as much history as possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have as little junk in the repo as possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>everything in the "master lineage" should always pass all tests</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These goals are slightly contradictory so the correct thing to do often
requires some judgement on part of the person doing the merge. Github
provides three different merge options, The rules of thumb for choosing
between them goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>single commit pull requests should always be rebased</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a pull request with one commit and one "fixup" commit (such as testing
something to see if it passes CI) should be squashed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>large branches with many commits should be merged with a merge commit,
especially if one of the commits does not pass all tests (which happens
in e.g. large and difficult refactorings)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If in doubt, ask for guidance on IRC.</p>
<h2 id="tests">Tests</h2>
<p>All new features must come with automatic tests that thoroughly prove that
the feature is working as expected. Similarly bug fixes must come with a
unit test that demonstrates the bug, proves that it has been fixed and
prevents the feature from breaking in the future.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is difficult to create a unit test for a given bug. If this is
the case, note this in your pull request. We may permit bug fix merge
requests in these cases. This is done on a case by case basis. Sometimes it
may be easier to write the test than convince the maintainers that one is
not needed. Exercise judgment and ask for help in problematic cases.</p>
<p>The tests are split into two different parts: unit tests and full project
tests. To run all tests, execute <code>./run_tests.py</code>. Unit tests can be run
with <code>./run_unittests.py</code> and project tests with <code>./run_project_tests.py</code>.</p>
<p>Each project test is a standalone project that can be compiled on its
own. They are all in <code>test cases</code> subdirectory. The simplest way to run a
single project test is to do something like <code>./meson.py test\ cases/common/1\ trivial builddir</code>. The one exception to this is <code>test cases/unit</code> directory discussed below.</p>
<p>The test cases in the <code>common</code> subdirectory are meant to be run always for
all backends. They should only depend on C and C++, without any external
dependencies such as libraries. Tests that require those are in the <code>test cases/frameworks</code> directory. If there is a need for an external program in
the common directory, such as a code generator, it should be implemented as
a Python script. The goal of test projects is also to provide sample
projects that end users can use as a base for their own projects.</p>
<p>All project tests follow the same pattern: they are compiled, tests are run
and finally install is run. Passing means that building and tests succeed
and installed files match the <code>installed_files.txt</code> file in the test's
source root. Any tests that require more thorough analysis, such as checking
that certain compiler arguments can be found in the command line or that the
generated pkg-config files actually work should be done with a unit test.</p>
<p>Projects needed by unit tests are in the <code>test cases/unit</code>
subdirectory. They are not run as part of <code>./run_project_tests.py</code>.</p>
<h3 id="skipping-integration-tests">Skipping integration tests</h3>
<p>Meson uses several continuous integration testing systems that have slightly
different interface. To promote consistent naming policy, use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>[skip ci]</code> in the commit title if you want to disable all integration
tests - <code>[skip appveyor]</code> in the commit title if you want to disable
Windows-only tests</li>
</ul>
<p>Continuous integration systems currently used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#Skipping-a-build">Travis-CI</a>
allows <code>[skip ci]</code> anywhere in the commit messages.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/how-to/filtering-commits/#skip-directive-in-commit-message">AppVeyor</a>
requires <code>[skip ci]</code> or <code>[skip appveyor]</code> in the commit title.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://sider.review">Sider</a>  runs Flake8 (see below)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>The <code>docs</code> directory contains the full documentation that will be used to
generate <a href="http://mesonbuild.com">the Meson web site</a>. Every change in
functionality must change the documentation pages. In most cases this means
updating the reference documentation page but bigger changes might need
changes in other documentation, too.</p>
<p>All new functionality needs to have a mention in the release notes. These
features should be written in standalone files in the
<code>docs/markdown/snippets</code> directory. The release manager will combine them
into one page when doing the release.</p>
<p><a href="Contributing.html#skipping-integration-tests">Integration tests should be disabled</a> for
documentation-only commits by putting <code>[skip ci]</code> into commit title.
Reviewers should ask contributors to put <code>[skip ci]</code> into the title because
tests are run again after merge for <code>master</code>.</p>
<h2 id="python-coding-style">Python Coding style</h2>
<p>Meson follows the basic Python coding style. Additional rules are the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>indent 4 spaces, no tabs ever</li>
<li>indent meson.build files with two spaces</li>
<li>try to keep the code as simple as possible</li>
<li>contact the mailing list before embarking on large scale projects to avoid
wasted effort</li>
</ul>
<p>Meson uses Flake8 for style guide enforcement. The Flake8 options for the
project are contained in setup.cfg.</p>
<p>To run Flake8 on your local clone of Meson:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ python3 -m pip install flake8 $ cd meson $ flake8
</code></pre>
<p>To run it automatically before committing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ flake8 --install-hook=git
$ git config --bool flake8.strict true
</code></pre>
<h2 id="cc-coding-style">C/C++ coding style</h2>
<p>Meson has a bunch of test code in several languages. The rules for those are
simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>indent 4 spaces, no tabs ever - brace always on the same line as
if/for/else/function definition</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="external-dependencies">External dependencies</h2>
<p>The goal of Meson is to be as easily usable as possible. The user experience
should be "get Python3 and Ninja, run", even on Windows. Unfortunately this
means that we can't have dependencies on projects outside of Python's
standard library. This applies only to core functionality, though. For
additional helper programs etc the use of external dependencies may be
ok. If you feel that you are dealing with this kind of case, please contact
the developers first with your use case.</p>
<h2 id="turing-completeness">Turing completeness</h2>
<p>The main design principle of Meson is that the definition language is not
Turing complete. Any change that would make Meson Turing complete is
automatically rejected. In practice this means that defining your own
functions inside <code>meson.build</code> files and generalised loops will not be added
to the language.</p>
<h2 id="do-i-need-to-sign-a-cla-in-order-to-contribute">Do I need to sign a CLA in order to contribute?</h2>
<p>No you don't. All contributions are welcome.</p>
<h2 id="no-lingering-state">No lingering state</h2>
<p>Meson operates in much the same way as functional programming languages. It
has inputs, which include <code>meson.build</code> files, values of options, compilers
and so on. These are passed to a function, which generates output build
definition. This function is pure, which means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>for any given input the output is always the same</li>
<li>running Meson twice in a row <em>always</em> produce the same output in both
runs</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter one is important, because it enforces that there is no way for
"secret state" to pass between consecutive invocations of Meson. This is the
reason why, for example, there is no <code>set_option</code> function even though there
is a <code>get_option</code> one.</p>
<p>If this were not the case, we could never know if the build output is
"stable". For example suppose there were a <code>set_option</code> function and a
boolean variable <code>flipflop</code>. Then you could do this:</p>
<p><code>meson set_option('flipflop', not get_option('flipflop'))</code></p>
<p>This piece of code would never converge. Every Meson run would change the
value of the option and thus the output you get out of this build definition
would be random.</p>
<p>Meson does not permit this by forbidding these sorts of covert channels.</p>
<p>There is one exception to this rule. Users can call into external commands
with <code>run_command</code>. If the output of that command does not behave like a
pure function, this problem arises. Meson does not try to guard against this
case, it is the responsibility of the user to make sure the commands they
run behave like pure functions.</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables">Environment variables</h2>
<p>Environment variables are like global variables, except that they are also
hidden by default. Envvars should be avoided whenever possible, all
functionality should be exposed in better ways such as command line
switches.</p>
