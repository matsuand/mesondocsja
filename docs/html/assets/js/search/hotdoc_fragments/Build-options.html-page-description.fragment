As an example a program may have two different data backends that are selectable at build time. Meson provides for this by having a option definition file. Its name is meson_options.txt and it is placed at the root of your source tree. \nHere is a simple option file. \nThis function also allows you to query the value of Meson s built in project options. For example to get the installation prefix you would issue the following command \nIt should be noted that you can not set option values in your Meson scripts. They have to be set externally with the meson configure command line tool. Running meson configure without arguments in a build dir shows you all options you can set. \nTo change their values use the D option \nNOTE If you cannot call meson configure you likely have a old version of Meson. In that case you can call mesonconf instead but that is deprecated in newer versions \n"});
