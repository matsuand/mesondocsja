fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Most non trivial builds require user settable options. As an example a program may have two different data backends that are selectable at build time. Meson provides for this by having a option definition file. Its name is meson_options.txt and it is placed at the root of your source tree. \nHere is a simple option file. \nThis demonstrates the three basic option types and their usage. String option is just a free form string and a boolean option is unsurprisingly true or false. The combo option can have any value from the strings listed in argument choices. If value is not set it defaults to empty string for strings true for booleans or the first element in a combo. You can specify description which is a free form piece of text describing the option. It defaults to option name. \nThese options are accessed in Meson code with the get_option function. \nThis function also allows you to query the value of Meson s built in project options. For example to get the installation prefix you would issue the following command \nIt should be noted that you can not set option values in your Meson scripts. They have to be set externally with the meson configure command line tool. Running meson configure without arguments in a build dir shows you all options you can set. \nTo change their values use the D option \nNOTE If you cannot call meson configure you likely have a old version of Meson. In that case you can call mesonconf instead but that is deprecated in newer versions \n", "url": "Build-options.html#page-description"});
