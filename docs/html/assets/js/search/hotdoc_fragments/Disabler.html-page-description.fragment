Basically it reduces to adding if else statements around all target invocations. Meson provides a simpler way of achieving the same with a disabler object. \nA disabler object is created with the disabler function \nmeson d disabler \nThe only thing you can do to a disabler object is to ask if it has been found \nmeson f d.found returns false \nAny other statement that uses a disabler object will immediately return a disabler. For example assuming that d contains a disabler object then \nThus to disable every target that depends on the dependency given above you can do something like this \nThis concentrates the handling of this option in one place and other build definition files do not need to be sprinkled with if statements. \n", "url": "Disabler.html#page-description"});
