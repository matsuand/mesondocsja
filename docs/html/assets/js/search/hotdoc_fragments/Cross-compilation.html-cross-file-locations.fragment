fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Cross file locations \nAs of version meson supports loading cross files from system locations on Linux and the BSDs. This will be XDG_DATA_DIRS meson cross or if XDG_DATA_DIRS is undefined then usr local share meson cross and usr share meson cross will be tried in that order for system wide cross files. User local files can be put in XDG_DATA_HOME meson cross or local share meson cross if that is undefined. \nThe order of locations tried is as follows \nLinux and BSD distributions are encouraged to ship cross files either with their cross compiler toolchain packages or as a standalone package and put them in one of the system paths referenced above. \nThese files can be loaded automatically without adding a path to the cross file. For example if a local share meson cross contains a file called x86 linux then the following command would start a cross build using that cross files \nsh meson builddir cross file x86 linux \n", "url": "Cross-compilation.html#cross-file-locations"});
