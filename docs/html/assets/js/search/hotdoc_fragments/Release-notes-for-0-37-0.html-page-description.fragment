This contains the values of the DESTDIR environment variable and the prefix option passed to Meson joined together. This is useful because both those are usually absolute paths and joining absolute paths in a cross platform way is tricky. os.path.join in Python will discard all previous path segments when it encounters an absolute path and simply concatenating them will not work on Windows where absolute paths begin with the drive letter. \n"});
