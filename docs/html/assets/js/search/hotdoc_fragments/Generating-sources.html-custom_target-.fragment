Using a custom target you can run this compiler at build time to generate the sources \nThe INPUT there will be transformed to somefile1.c file2.c Just like the output you can also refer to each input file individually by index. \nThen you just put that in your program and you re done. \n", "url": "Generating-sources.html#custom_target-"});
