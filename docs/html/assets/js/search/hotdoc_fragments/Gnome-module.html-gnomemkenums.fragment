The first argument is the base name of the output files. \nThis method is essentially a wrapper around the glib mkenums tool s command line API. It is the most featureful method for enum creation. \nTypically you either provide template files or you specify the various template sections manually as strings. \nMost libraries and applications will be using the same standard template with only minor tweaks in which case the gnome.mkenums_simple convenience method can be used instead. \nNote that if you include the generated header in any of the sources for a build target you must add the generated header to the build target s list of sources to codify the dependency. This is true for all generated sources not just mkenums. \nAdded \nReturns an array of two elements which are c_source header_file \n"});
