If you have subprojects that themselves have subprojects you must transfer them to the top level. This can be done by going to your source root and issuing a promotion command. \nThis will cause Meson to go through your entire project tree find an embedded subproject and copy it to the top level. \nIf there are multiple embedded copies of a subproject Meson will not try to guess which one you want. Instead it will print all the possibilities. You can then manually select which one to promote by writing it out fully. \nThis functionality was added in Meson release \n"});
