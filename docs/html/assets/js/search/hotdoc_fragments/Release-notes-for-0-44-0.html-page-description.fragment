The generated code might not match the input files when the linking with the moc input sources happens. \nThis amendment allows to specify a a list of additional arguments passed to the moc tool. They are called moc_extra_arguments. \nsharedstatedir \nThese options now default in a way consistent with FHS and common usage. \nIf prefix is usr default sysconfdir to etc localstatedir to var and sharedstatedir to var lib. \nIf prefix is usr local the default default localstatedir to var local and sharedstatedir to var local lib. \nPreviously to have an option that took more than one value a string value would have to be created and split but validating this was difficult. A new array type has been added to the meson_options.txt for this case. It works like a combo but allows more than one option to be passed. The values can optionally be validated against a list of valid values. When used on the command line with D values are passed as a comma separated list. \nIf you replace the dependency with a disabler object like this \nThen the shared library executable and unit test are not created. This is a handy mechanism to cut down on the number of if statements. \nA number of dependencies CUPS LLVM pcap WxWidgets GnuStep use a config tool instead of pkg config. As of this version they now have a get_configtool_variable method which is analogous to the get_pkgconfig_variable for pkg config. \n"});
