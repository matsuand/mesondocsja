By default Meson generates a debug build which turns on basic warnings and debug information and disables compiler optimizations. \nYou can specify a different type of build with the buildtype command line argument. It can have one of the following values. \nThe build directory is mandatory. The reason for this is that it simplifies the build process immensely. Meson will not under any circumstances write files inside the source directory if it does it is a bug and should be fixed This means that the user does not need to add a bunch of files to their revision control s ignore list. It also means that you can create arbitrarily many build directories for any given source tree. If we wanted to test building the source code with the Clang compiler instead of the system default we could just type the following commands. \nThis separation is even more powerful if your code has multiple configuration options such as multiple data backends You can create a separate subdirectory for each of them. You can also have build directories for optimized builds code coverage static analysis and so on. They are all neatly separated and use the same source tree. Changing between different configurations is just a question of changing to the corresponding directory. \nUnless otherwise mentioned all following command line invocations are meant to be run in the build directory. \nBy default Meson will use the Ninja backend to build your project. If you wish to use any of the other backends you need to pass the corresponding argument during configuration time. As an example here is how you would use Meson to generate a Visual studio solution. \nYou can then open the generated solution with Visual Studio and compile it in the usual way. A list of backends can be obtained with meson help. \n", "url": "Running-Meson.html#page-description"});
