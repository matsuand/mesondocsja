It is proof of concept code that works in the system as it currently exists February but may change at any time. \nLet s start simple. Here is the code to compile a single executable binary. \nmeson project compile one c executable program prog.c \nThis is about as simple as one can get. First you declare the project name and the languages it uses. Then you specify the binary to build and its sources. The build system will do all the rest. It will add proper suffixes e.g. exe on Windows set the default compiler flags and so on. \nUsually programs have more than one source file. Listing them all in the function call can become unwieldy. That is why the system supports keyword arguments. They look like this. \n", "url": "Design-rationale.html#sample-code"});
