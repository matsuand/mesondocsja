Meson supports this with keyword arguments. \nIt is common to build a library and then an executable that links against it. This is supported as well. \nMeson sets things up so that the resulting executable can be run directly from the build directory. There is no need to write shell scripts or set environment variables. \nOne target can have multiple language source files. \n", "url": "Build-targets.html#page-description"});
