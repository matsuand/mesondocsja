A more in depth description can be found in the the configuration wiki page It has three methods \nget varname default_value returns the value of varname if the value has not been set returns default_value if it is defined added and errors out if not \nget_unquoted varname default_value returns the value of varname but without surrounding double quotes If the value has not been set returns default_value if it is defined and errors out if not. Available since \nhas varname returns true if the specified variable is set \nmerge_from other takes as argument a different configuration data object and copies all entries from that object to the current object available since \nset varname value sets a variable to a given value \nset10 varname boolean_value is the same as above but the value is either true or false and will be written as or respectively \nset_quoted varname value is same as set but quotes the value in double quotes \nThey all take the description keyword that will be written in the result file. The replacement assumes a file with C syntax. If your generated file is source code in some other language you probably don t want to add a description field because it most likely will cause a syntax error. \n"});
