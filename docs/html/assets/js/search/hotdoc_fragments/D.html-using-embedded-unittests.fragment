fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Using embedded unittests \nIf you are using embedded unittest functions your source code needs to be compiled twice once in regular mode and once with unittests active. This is done by setting the d_unittest target property to true. Meson will only ever pass the respective compiler s unittest flag and never have the compiler generate an empty main function. If you need that feature in a portable way create an empty main function for unittests yourself since the GNU D compiler does not have this feature. \nThis is an example for using D unittests with Meson \n", "url": "D.html#using-embedded-unittests"});
