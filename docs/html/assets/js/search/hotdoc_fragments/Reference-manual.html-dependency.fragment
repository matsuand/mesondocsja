fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Reference-manual.html#dependency", "fragment": "dependency \nFinds an external dependency usually a library installed on your system with the given name with pkg config if possible and with library specific fallback detection logic otherwise. This function supports the following keyword arguments \nIf dependency_name is the dependency is always not found. So with required false this always returns a dependency object for which the found method returns false and which can be passed like any other dependency to the dependencies keyword argument of a build_target. This can be used to implement a dependency which is sometimes not required e.g. in some branches of a conditional. \nThe returned object also has methods that are documented in the object methods section below. \n"});
