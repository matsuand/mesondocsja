With Meson you don t have to care about the details just pass gtest or gmock to dependency and it will do everything for you. If you want to use GMock it is recommended to use GTest as well as getting it to work standalone is tricky. \nYou can set the main keyword argument to true to use the main function provided by GTest gtest_dep dependency gtest main true required false e executable testprog test.cc dependencies gtest_dep test gtest test e MPI \nMPI is supported for C C and Fortran. Because dependencies are language specific you must specify the requested language using the language keyword argument i.e. \nMeson prefers pkg config for MPI but if your MPI implementation does not provide them it will search for the standard wrapper executables mpic mpicxx mpic mpifort mpif90 mpif77. If these are not in your path they can be specified by setting the standard environment variables MPICC MPICXX MPIFC MPIF90 or MPIF77 during configuration. \n"});
