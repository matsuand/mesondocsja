fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "Localisation \nLocalising your application with GNU gettext takes a little effort but is quite straightforward. This documentation assumes that you have a po subdirectory at your project root directory that contains all the localisation info. \nThe first thing you need is a file called POTFILES. It lists all the source files that gettext should scan in order to find strings to translate. The syntax of the file is one line per source file and the line must contain the relative path from source root. A sample POTFILES might look like this. \nWe also need to define an array of strings containing all the locales we want to generate. This is done in the Meson file in the po subdirectory. Assuming we want to generate Finnish and German localisations the definition would look like this. \nmeson langs fi de \nThen we need to generate the main pot file. Usually this is generated manually or exists already. If not see later on how to generate it using Meson. The potfile can have any name but is usually the name of the gettext package. Let s say the project is called intltest. In this case the corresponding pot file would be called intltest.pot. \nFor each language listed in the array above we need a corresponding po file. This has to be generated manually see the gettext manual for details. Once we have all this we can define the localisation to Meson with these lines. \n", "url": "Localisation.html#localisation"});
