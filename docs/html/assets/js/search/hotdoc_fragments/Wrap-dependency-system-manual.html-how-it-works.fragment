fragment_downloaded_cb({"fragment": "How it works \nMeson has a concept of subprojects. They are a way of nesting one Meson project inside another. Any project that builds with Meson can detect that it is built as a subproject and build itself in a way that makes it easy to use usually this means as a static library \nTo use this kind of a project as a dependency you could just copy and extract it inside your project s subprojects directory. However there is a simpler way. You can specify a Wrap file that tells Meson how to download it for you. An example wrap file would look like this and should be put in subprojects foobar.wrap \nThen in your main project you would use them like this \nNote that the subproject object is not used as the dependency but rather you need to get the declared dependency from it with get_variable because a subproject may have multiple declared dependencies. \n", "url": "Wrap-dependency-system-manual.html#how-it-works"});
