"The front page lists all projects that are on the service. Select the one "
"you want and click it. The detail page lists available versions by branch "
"and revision id. The branch names come from upstream releases and revision "
"ids are version numbers internal to the database. Whenever the packaging is "
"updated a new revision is released to the service a new revision with a "
"bigger revision id is added. Usually you want to select the newest branch "
"with the highest revision id."
