"[CCache](https://ccache.samba.org/) is a cache system designed to make "
"compiling faster. When you run Meson for the first time for a given project, "
"it checks if CCache is installed. If it is, Meson will use it automatically."

"If you do not wish to use CCache for some reason, just specify your compiler "

"(remember that once specified the compiler can not be changed). Meson will "

"When doing a code coverage build, Meson will check the existence of binaries "
"`gcovr`, `lcov` and `genhtml`. If the first one is found, it will create "
"targets called *coverage-text* and *coverage-xml*. If the latter two are "
"found, it generates the target *coverage-html*. You can then generate "
"coverage reports just by calling e.g. `ninja coverage-xml`."
