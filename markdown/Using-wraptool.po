"using the WrapDB database. It gives you all things you would expect, such as "
"installing and updating dependencies. The wrap tool works on all platforms, "
"the only limitation is that the wrap definition works on your target "
"platform. If you find some Wraps that don't work, please file bugs or, even "
"better, patches."
