"Wraptool is a subcommand of Meson that allows you to manage your source "
"dependencies using the WrapDB database. It gives you all things you would "
"expect, such as installing and updating dependencies. The wrap tool works on "
"all platforms, the only limitation is that the wrap definition works on your "
"target platform. If you find some Wraps that don't work, please file bugs "
"or, even better, patches."
