"There have been many Python programs that are difficult to maintain on "
"multiple platforms. The reasons come mostly from dependencies. The program "
"may use dependencies that are hard to compile on certain platforms, are "
"outdated, conflict with other dependencies, not available on a given Python "
"version and so on."

"Meson avoids dependency problems with one simple rule: Meson is not allowed "
"to have any dependencies outside the Python basic library. The only thing "

"Meson has been designed in such a way that the implementation language is "
"never exposed in the build definitions. This makes it possible (and maybe "
"even easy) to reimplement Meson in any other programming language. There are "
"currently no plans to reimplement Meson, but we will make sure that Python "
"is not exposed inside the build definitions."

"There is no one technical solution or programming language that works "

"It is also the case that as any project gets larger, sooner or later it "
"requires code generation, scripting or other tooling. This seems to be "
"inevitable. Because there is no scripting language that would be available "
"everywhere, these tools either need to be rewritten for each platform (which "
"is a lot of work and is prone to errors) or the project needs to take a "
"dependency on _something_."

"Any project that uses Meson (at least the current version) can rely on the "
"fact that Python 3 will always be available, because you can't compile the "
"project without it. All tooling can then be done in Python 3 with the "
"knowledge that it will run on any platform without any extra dependencies "
"(modulo the usual porting work). This reduces maintenance effort on "
"multiplatform projects by a fair margin."
