"The Boost dependency has been improved to better detect the various ways to "
"install boost on multiple platforms. At the same time the `modules` "
"semantics for the dependency has been changed. Previously it was allowed to "
"specify header directories as `modules` but it wasn't required. Now, modules "
"are only used to specify libraries that require linking."
