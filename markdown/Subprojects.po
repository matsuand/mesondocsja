"Meson tries to solve this problem by making it extremely easy to provide "
"both at the same time. The way this is done is that Meson allows you to take "
"any other Meson project and make it a part of your build without (in the "
"best case) any changes to its Meson setup. It becomes a transparent part of "
"the project. The basic idiom goes something like this."

"Finally if you can have subprojects anywhere, this increases the possibility "
"of having many different (possibly incompatible) versions of a dependency in "

"traverse directories) may cause a completely different version of the "
"subproject to be used by accident."
