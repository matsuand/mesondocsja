"Some platforms do not provide a native packaging system. In these cases it "

"Meson tries to solve this problem by making it extremely easy to provide "
"both at the same time. The way this is done is that Meson allows you to take "
"any other Meson project and make it a part of your build without (in the "
"best case) any changes to its Meson setup. It becomes a transparent part of "
"the project. The basic idiom goes something like this."

"All Meson features of the subproject, such as project options keep working "

"project before calling subproject. Subprojects must not set global arguments "
"because there is no way to do that reliably over multiple subprojects. To "
"check whether you are running as a subproject, use the `is_subproject` "
