"The input to this function is the set of Verilog files and a constraint "
"file. This produces output files called `projname.asc`, `projname.blif` and "
"`projname.bin`. In addition it creates two run targets called `projname-"
"time` for running timing analysis and `projname-upload` that uploads the "
"generated bitstream to an FPGA device using the `iceprog` programming "
"executable."
