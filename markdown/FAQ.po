"One of the main requirements of Meson is that it must be fast. This means "
"that a no-op build in a tree of 10 000 source files must take no more than a "
"fraction of a second. This is only possible because Meson knows the exact "
"list of files to check. If any target is specified as a wildcard glob, this "
"is no longer possible. Meson would need to re-evaluate the glob every time "
"and compare the list of files produced against the previous list. This means "
"inspecting the entire source tree (because the glob pattern could be `src/"
"\\*/\\*/\\*/\\*.cpp` or something like that). This is impossible to do "
