"[Pkg-config](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkg-config) is a way for shared "
"libraries to declare the compiler flags needed to use them. There are two "
"different ways of generating Pkg-config files in Meson. The first way is to "
"build them manually with the `configure_file` command. The second way is to "
"use Meson's built in Pkg-config file generator. The difference between the "
"two is that the latter is very simple and meant for basic use cases. The "
"former should be used when you need to provide a more customized solution."
