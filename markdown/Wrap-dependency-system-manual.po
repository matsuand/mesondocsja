"One of the major problems of multiplatform development is wrangling all your "
"dependencies. This is easy on Linux where you can use system packages but "
"awkward on other platforms. Most of those do not have a package manager at "
"all. This has been worked around by having third party package managers. "
"They are not really a solution for end user deployment, because you can't "
"tell them to install a package manager just to use your app. On these "
"platforms you must produce self-contained applications."

"Meson has a concept of [subprojects](Subprojects.md). They are a way of "
"nesting one Meson project inside another. Any project that builds with Meson "
"can detect that it is built as a subproject and build itself in a way that "
"makes it easy to use (usually this means as a static library)."

"To use this kind of a project as a dependency you could just copy and "
"extract it inside your project's `subprojects` directory. However there is a "
"simpler way. You can specify a Wrap file that tells Meson how to download it "

"`subprojects/foobar.wrap`:"
