"Creating Linux binaries that can be downloaded and run on any distro (like ."
"dmg packages for OSX or .exe installers for Windows) has traditionally been "
"difficult. This is even more tricky if you want to use modern compilers and "
"features, which is especially desired in game development. There is still no "
"simple turn-key solution for this problem but with a bit of setup it can be "
"relatively straightforward."
