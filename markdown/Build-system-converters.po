"Moving from one build system into another includes a fair bit of work. To "
"make things easier, Meson provides scripts to convert other build systems "
"into Meson. At the time of writing, scripts for CMake and autotools exist. "
"It can be found in the `tools` subdirectory in Meson's source tree."

"The scripts do not try to do a perfect conversion. This would be extremely "
"difficult because the data models of other build systems are very different. "
"The goal of the converter script is to convert as much of the low level "
"drudgery as possible. Using the scripts is straightforward. We'll use the "
"CMake one as an example but the Autotools one works exactly the same way."
