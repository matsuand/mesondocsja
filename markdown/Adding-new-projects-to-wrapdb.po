"The wrap provider service is a simple web service that makes it easy to "
"download build definitions for projects. It works in much the same way as "
"Debian: we take the unaltered upstream source package and add a new build "
"system to it as a patch. These build systems are stored as Git repositories "
"on GitHub. They only contain build definition files. You may also think of "
"them as an overlay to upstream source."

"Wrapped subprojects are used much like external dependencies. Thus they "
"should have the same name as the upstream projects. If the project provides "
"a pkg-config file, then the repository name should be the same as the pkg-"
"config name. Usually this is the name of the project, such as `libpng`. "
"Sometimes it is slightly different, however. As an example the libogg "
"project's chosen pkg-config name is `ogg` instead of `libogg`, which is the "
"reason why the repository is named plain `ogg`."
