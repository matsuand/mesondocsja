"Since the very beginning Meson has provided different project types to use, "
"such as *debug* and *minsize*. There is also a *plain* type that adds "
"nothing by default but instead makes it the user's responsibility to add "
"everything by hand. This works but is a bit tedious."

"In this release we have added new new options to manually toggle "
"e.g. optimization levels and debug info so those can be changed "
"independently of other options. For example by default the debug buildtype "
"has no optmization enabled at all. If you wish to use GCC's `-Og` instead, "
"you could set it with the following command:"

"Similarly we have added a toggle option to select the version of Visual "
"Studio C runtime to use. By default it uses the debug runtime DLL debug "
"builds and release DLL for release builds but this can be manually changed "
"with the new base option `b_vscrt`."
