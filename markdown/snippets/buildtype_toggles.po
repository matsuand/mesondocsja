"Since the very beginning Meson has provided different project types to use, "
"such as *debug* and *minsize*. There is also a *plain* type that adds "
"nothing by default but instead makes it the user's responsibility to add "
"everything by hand. This works but is a bit tedious."

"In this release we have added new new options to manually toggle e.g. "
"optimization levels and debug info so those can be changed independently of "

"with the following command:"

"Similarly we have added a toggle option to select the version of Visual "
