"A common question is *Why should I choose Meson over a different build "
"system X?* There is no one true answer to this as it depends on the use "
"case. Almost all build systems have all the functionality needed to build "
"medium-to-large projects so the decision is usually made on other points. "
"Here we list some pros and cons of various build systems to help you do the "
"decision yourself."

"Slow. Requires you to pass your configuration settings on every invocation. "

"system remembers build options from the previous invocation."

"The fastest build system [see measurements](Performance-comparison.md), user "
